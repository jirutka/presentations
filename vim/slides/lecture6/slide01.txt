Plugins for Vim
--------------------------------
▶ Global installation into $VIMRUNTIME/
    echo $VIMRUNTIME
▶ Local installation (per user)
    into ~/.vim
    want to be sure the path is correct?
        :set runtimepath?
▶ How to work with multiple plugins?
    Shared directories (autoload, doc, shell, syntax, ...)
    Could end in DLL hell :)
    Solution: some sort of Vim Package Manager
▶ Vim Pathogen
    All packages use ~/.vim/bundle and goes into separate directories
