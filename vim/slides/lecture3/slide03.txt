Working with tags
-----------------
▶ How to create tags file
    ◆ ctags
    ◆ ctags * (to force generating for BASH scripts etc.)
    ◆ ctags -R
    ◆ ctags -R /usr/lib/include
        • quite big files, might be better to try man pages instead
        • Shift+K
▶ How to jump to definition
    :tag symbol              TAB completion
     g+   left button        does not work in terminal
     Ctrl+left button        does not work in terminal
     Ctrl+]                  in visual mode :tag
▶ Go back
    ◆ Ctrl+T
▶ Vim help is created similarly, ie. use Ctrl+] and Ctrl+T etc.
